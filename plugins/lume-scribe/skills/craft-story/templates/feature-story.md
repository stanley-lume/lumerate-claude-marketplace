## Context

> What's the problem, and what are we building?

## What We're Building (Acceptance Criteria)

> What does a successful outcome look like? Focus on the result, not how to build it. Edge cases can be considered here.

## How We'll Build It

**Database schema changes:**

**New database fields (names and types):**

**Business logic design:**

> How will the business logic be implemented? Reference code from the initial/commit skeleton if applicable.

**Mixpanel tracking:**

**Testing strategy:**

> e.g., unit, integration, end-to-end

**Performance requirements:**

> e.g., "must respond in under 1 second"

**New logs or metrics:**

> What should we add to track this?

## How We'll Release It

> Getting the feature to production and making sure it works.

**Testing outside of development:**

> e.g., manual tests, a feature flag

**Production monitoring:**

> What dashboards or alerts should we set up?
